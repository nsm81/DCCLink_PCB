# DCCLink_PCB

The DCCLink board connects the DCC track signal to an Arduino. It also provides a regulated 5V supply from the track. It does not provide DCC ACK support for PoM (Programming on the main).

The board is designed and made in KiCad 6.0.


I reccomend using the AP_DCC_Library written by Aiko Pras.
